<p>
  Up to now, I have been working on modelling the resilience of transport and urban systems to extreme events since 2016. I instigated three fundings (e.g., EPSRC, Leverhulme), authored/co-authored numerous peer-reviewed journal papers, involved in five projects, and developed two software packages, ResilienceNet and Dynamic ResilienceNet, to examine resilience of networks against disturbances such as extreme weather events.
</p>

<p>I have a range of research interests that fall broadly under the umbrella of transport geography, urban analytics, and energy.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Modelling the resilience of urban, public transport networks and energy transaction resilience</li>
  <li>Spatio-temporal analysis of EV charger accessibility and charging behaviour</li>
  <li>GeoAI (Geospatial, machine learning, and text mining) in Transport and Energy</li>
</ul>


## Research Interests
